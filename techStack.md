# Technology Stack

## Backend
- **Python + Django**: Main backend framework
  - Handles data processing, predictions, and database management
  - Django ORM for database interactions
  - Django's built-in authentication system for user management
- **Node.js + Express.js**: For real-time services
  - Handles WebSocket connections for live updates

## Database
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database
  - Robust data management
  - Support for complex queries

## Frontend
- **Argon Dashboard Django**: Template for building the web interface
  - Provides responsive and modern UI components
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For custom frontend development

## Data Retrieval
- Web scraping tools (to be determined) for gathering real-time stock data

## Charts and Visualizations
- (To be determined, possibly Chart.js or D3.js)

## Development Tools
- Git: Version control
- Virtual Environment: For Python dependency management

## Deployment
- (To be determined, possibly Heroku or AWS)

## Additional Libraries and Frameworks
- (To be added as development progresses)

## Architectural Decisions
1. Use of Django for backend due to its robustness and ORM capabilities
2. Separation of real-time services to Node.js for better performance
3. Choice of PostgreSQL for its ability to handle complex financial data queries
4. Use of a pre-built dashboard template to speed up frontend development

This tech stack provides a solid foundation for building a scalable and efficient stock analysis and prediction application. It will be updated as development progresses and new requirements emerge.

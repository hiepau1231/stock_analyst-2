# Current Task: Implementing Core Functionality

## Progress
1. Set up the Django project structure
2. Created basic Django apps (authentication, stock_analysis, predictions, real_time_services)
3. Initialized Git repository
4. Set up Node.js for real-time services
5. Installed necessary Python and Node.js packages
6. Created a basic Node.js server for WebSocket connections
7. Successfully ran both Django and Node.js servers concurrently

## Next Steps
1. Set up the Argon Dashboard Django template
   - Download and integrate the template into the project
   - Customize the template to fit the stock analysis theme
2. Define models for each app
   - Authentication: User model (if custom fields are needed)
   - Stock Analysis: Stock, StockData, Analysis models
   - Predictions: Prediction model
3. Create basic views and templates
   - Implement a dashboard view
   - Create views for stock listing, individual stock details, and predictions
4. Set up URL routing
   - Configure URLs for all created views
   - Ensure proper namespace usage for each app
5. Implement real-time functionality using WebSockets
   - Set up WebSocket connections for live stock data updates
   - Implement real-time data fetching and processing
6. Develop stock analysis features
   - Implement data retrieval from a reliable stock API
   - Create analysis algorithms (e.g., moving averages, RSI, MACD)
7. Develop prediction features
   - Research and implement a suitable prediction algorithm
   - Create a scheduling system for regular prediction updates

## Immediate Focus for Next Session
- Set up the Argon Dashboard Django template
- Begin defining models for each app

## Notes
- Ensure all new features are properly tested
- Keep the code modular and follow Django best practices
- Regularly update requirements.txt and package.json as new dependencies are added
